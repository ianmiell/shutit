## Default core config file for ShutIt.
#  If this file is in the core of ShutIt it should only
#  ever be changed by the maintainer/BDFL.
#  If it's been copied into a module, then the maintainer
#  of that module only should be changing it.
#  If you are a developer on SI or the module, change the
#  config specific to your run (ie configs/<hostname>_<username>.cnf)
#  
#  Submit a pull request to the maintainer if you want the
#  default.cnf changed.
